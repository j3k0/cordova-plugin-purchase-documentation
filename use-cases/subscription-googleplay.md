# Paid Subscription with Google Play

This guide uses the plugin at version 13 or later (which is in beta at this stage).


# Subscription on Android

In this guide, we will build a small application with a subscription that works on Android with Google Play.


## Setup for Google Play

### 1. Install Dependencies


Needless to say, make sure you have the tools installed on your machine. During the writing of this guide, I've been using the following environment:

* **NodeJS** v10.12.0
* **Cordova** v8.1.2
* **macOS** 10.14.1

I'm not saying it won't work with different version. If you start fresh, it might be a good idea to use an up-to-date environment.


### 2. Create Cordova Project


Making sure we have a Cordova project that we can build for Android and/or iOS.

#### Create the project

#### Create the project

If it isn't already created:

```text
$ cordova create CordovaProject cc.fovea.purchase.demo PurchaseNC
Creating a new cordova project.
```

For details about what those parameters are:

```text
$ cordova help create
```

Note, feel free to pick a different project ID and name. Remember whatever values you put in here.

Let's head into our cordova project's directory \(should match whatever we used in the previous step.

```text
$ cd CordovaProject
```
#### Add Android platform

```text
$ cordova platform add android
```

Will output:

```text
    Using cordova-fetch for cordova-android@~11.0.0
    Adding android project...
    [...]
    Saving android@~11.0.0 into config.xml file ...
```

Let's check if that builds.

```text
$ cordova build android
```

Which outputs:

```text
    Android Studio project detected
    Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)
    [...]
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 49s
    Built the following apk(s):
    __EDITED__/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Hopefully there's no problems with our Android build chain. If you do have problems, fixing it is out of scope from this guide but it's required!


### 3. Create Google Play Application


Make sure we have a Google Play application created and configured.

### Create the App

* Open the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
* Click "Create Application", fill in the required fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
Need more help? I recommend you check [Google's own documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469?hl=en&ref_topic=7072031). It's well detailed, easy to follow and probably the most up-to-date resource you can find.
{% endhint %}


### 4. Install Cordova Purchase Plugin


To install the plugin, we will use the usual `cordova plugin add` command.

```text
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-purchase"
```

Now let's try to build.

```text
cordova build android
```

Successful build?

```text
[...]
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
```

All good! Seems like we can build an app with support for the Billing API.

Let's now prepare a release APK.


### 5. Android Release APK


To generate a release build, I generally use the following script: [android-release.sh](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/28f60a7d5622508634d09f94c59d6dfc)

The script calls `cordova build android --release` with the correct command line arguments. It requires you have generated a `keystore` file for your application already.

If you haven't generated a keystore file for your application yet, you can use the following command line:

```text
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android-release.keystore -alias release \
-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

I'll ask you a few questions. The only tricky one is "Do you wan't to use the same password for the alias?", the answer is _yes_. Please note that the above command defines the keystore's `alias` as **release**, you can use any value, but just remember the value you chose.

Keep the `android-release.keystore` file in a safe place, backup it everywhere you can! Don't loose it, don't loose the password. You won't EVER be able to update your app on Google Play without it!

Then build.

```text
$ export KEYSTORE_ALIAS=release
$ export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=my_password
$ ./android-release.sh
```

Replace `$KEYSTORE_ALIAS` and `$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with whatever match your those from your `keystore` file...

The output should end with a line like this:

```text
Build is ready:

<SOME_PATH>/android-release-20181015-1145.apk
```

There you go, this is your first release APK.


### 6. Upload to Google Play


Once you have built your release APK, you need to upload it to Google Play in order to be able to test In-App Purchases. In-App Purchase is not enabled in "debug build". In order to test in-app purchase, your APK needs to be signed with your release signing key. In order for Google to know your release signing key for this application, you need to upload a release APK:

* Signed with this key.
* Have the BILLING permission enabled
  * it is done when you add the plugin to your project, so make sure you didn't skip this step.

Google already provides [detailed resource on how to upload a release build](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011). What we want here is to:

1. create an **internal testing release**
2. **upload** it
3. **publish** it \(privately probably\).

Once you went over those steps, you can test your app with in-app purchase enabled without uploading to Google Play each time, but you need to sign the APK with the same "release" signing key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that it might up to 24 hours for your IAP to work after you uploaded the first release APK.
{% endhint %}


### 7. Create In-App Products


There is still a bit more preparatory work: we need to setup our in-app product.

Back in the "Google Play Console", open the "Store presence" ⇒ "In-app products" section.

![](../.gitbook/assets/google-play-in-app-products.png)

If you haven't yet uploaded an APK, it'll warn you that you need to upload a *release* APK.

Once this is done, you can create a product. Google offers 2 kinds of products:

* Managed Products
* Subscriptions

The latest is for auto-renewing subscriptions, in all other cases, you should a "Managed Product".

* Click the **CREATE** button.
* Fill in all the required information \(title, description, prices\).
* Make sure the Status is **ACTIVE**.
* **SAVE**

And we're done!

{% hint style="info" %}
There's might be some delay between creating a product on the Google Play Console and seeing it in your app. If your product doesn't show up after 24h, then you should start to worry.
{% endhint %}


### 8. Prepare Test Accounts


To test your Google Play Billing implementation with actual in-app purchases, you must use a test account. By default, the only test account registered is the one that's associated with your developer account. You can register additional test accounts by using the Google Play Console.

1. Navigate to Settings > Account details.
2. In the License Testing section, add your tester's email addresses to Gmail accounts with testing access field.
3. Save your changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Testers can begin making purchases of your in-app products within 15 minutes.
{% endhint %}

### 9. Setup Receipt Validation Server (Google Play)

Reliably managing Android subscriptions, especially determining the exact expiry date and renewal status, requires communication with the **Google Play Developer API**. The purchase plugin itself does not directly communicate with this server-side API. You need an intermediary service for this, often referred to as a receipt validation server.

While you can build your own server to interact with the Google Play Developer API, this guide will use **Iaptic** (the service developed by the plugin's author) which simplifies this process.

**Why is this needed for Android Subscriptions?**

*   **Accurate Expiry Dates:** Local receipt data on Android doesn't always contain a reliable expiry date, especially after renewals or cancellations. The Google Play Developer API is the source of truth.
*   **Renewal Status:** Checking if a subscription will auto-renew or has been cancelled requires server-side checks.
*   **Grace Periods & Account Hold:** Handling billing issues requires server-side status information.

**Steps using Iaptic:**

1.  **Create an Iaptic Account:** If you haven't already, sign up at [iaptic.com](https://www.iaptic.com/).
2.  **Connect with Google Play Developer API:**
    *   Navigate to your Iaptic project settings.
    *   Find the "Google Play" section.
    *   Follow the instructions provided by Iaptic to connect your Google Play Developer account. This typically involves:
        *   Creating a **Service Account** in your Google Cloud Console project that is linked to your Google Play Developer Console.
        *   Granting the necessary permissions (like "View financial data" and "Manage orders and subscriptions") to this Service Account within the Google Play Console.
        *   Uploading the JSON key file for the Service Account to Iaptic.
    *   Iaptic provides detailed guides for this process: [Connect With Google](https://www.iaptic.com/documentation/connect-with-google-publisher-api/)
3.  **Configure the Plugin:**
    *   Go to the "Setup" section in your Iaptic dashboard and find the "Cordova" setup instructions.
    *   Copy the provided `store.validator` URL. It will look something like `https://validator.iaptic.com/...`.
    *   Paste this URL into your application's initialization code where you configure the store validator:

    ```javascript
    // In your initStore() or equivalent function
    const iaptic = new CdvPurchase.Iaptic({
      appName: "[Your Iaptic App Name]", // Replace with your actual App Name
      apiKey: "[Your Iaptic Public Key]" // Replace with your actual Public Key
    });
    CdvPurchase.store.validator = iaptic.validator;
    ```

    *   Ensure your `Content-Security-Policy` in `index.html` allows connections to `validator.iaptic.com` (or your custom Iaptic domain).

{% hint style="info" %}
Iaptic's validation service is often free or has a generous free tier during development (using test purchases) and offers paid plans for production use. Check their pricing for details.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Skipping this server-side validation step for Android subscriptions will lead to unreliable expiry date information and difficulty in managing subscription states correctly.
{% endhint %}

With the validator configured and connected to the Google Play Developer API, the plugin, via Iaptic, can now retrieve accurate subscription details during the validation process.
## Code Implementation

This section describes the minimal code required to implement an auto-renewing subscription product on Android using the Google Play platform.

### Base framework

First, let's set up the basic HTML structure and the initial JavaScript to load the plugin.


#### index.html

Assuming you're starting from a blank project, we'll add the minimal amount of HTML for the purpose of this tutorial. Let's replace the `<body>` from the `www/index.html` file with the below.

```markup
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

Let's also make sure to comment out Cordova template project's CSS.

You also need to enable the `'unsafe-inline'` `Content-Security-Policy` by adding it to the `default-src` section:

```markup
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' [...]" />
```

You can download the [full index.html file here](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/80c69837e5bacf83c4fc2320ba2e5dc2).
#### javascript


We will now create a new JavaScript file and load it from the HTML. The code below will initialize the plugin.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady);

function onDeviceReady() {

  if (!window.CdvPurchase) {
      console.log('CdvPurchase is not available');
      return;
  }
  const {store} = CdvPurchase;

  store.error(function(error) {
      console.log('ERROR ' + error.code + ': ' + error.message);
  });

  store.ready(function() {
    console.log("CdvPurchase is ready");
  });
 
  initializeStore();
  refreshUI();
}

function initializeStore() {
  // We will implement this soon
}

function refreshUI() {
  // Soon...
}
```
{% endcode %}

Here's a little explanation:

**Line 1**, it's important to wait for the "deviceready" event before using cordova plugins.

**Lines 5-8**, we check if the plugin was correctly loaded.

**Lines 11-13**, we setup an error handler. It just logs errors to the console.

> Whatever your setup is, you should make sure this runs as soon as the javascript application starts. You have to be ready to handle IAP events as soon as possible.

### Initialization & Presentation

Now, we'll initialize the plugin, register our subscription products, and set up the UI to display their status and purchase options. This involves:
*   Registering products with type `PAID_SUBSCRIPTION`.
*   Setting up a receipt validator connected to the Google Play Developer API (required for reliable subscription handling on Android - see Step 9 in the setup).
*   Displaying product details (title, description, price, billing period, trial info).
*   Displaying the current subscription status (subscribed, expired, in grace period) based on verified receipt data.
*   Showing a "Subscribe" button only when the product `canPurchase`.


### Initialization

Assuming you're starting from a blank project, we'll add the minimal amount of HTML for the purpose of this tutorial. Let's replace the `<body>` from the `www/index.html` file with the below.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' https://reeceipt-validator.fovea.cc 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' gap:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *">
</head>
<body style="margin-top: 50px">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to comment out Cordova template project's CSS.

We enabled the `'unsafe-inline'` `Content-Security-Policy` by adding it to the `default-src` section.

Since we'll be using [Fovea.Billing](https://billing.fovea.cc), you also need to add your validation server to default-src, find your in the [cordova setup documentation](https://billing-dashboard.fovea.cc/setup/cordova). On my case it's `https://reeceipt-validation.fovea.cc`.

Let's now or edit the JavaScript file `js/index.js`. Replace the content with the code below, which will setup a minimal application framework and render some HTML into the page based on the app state.


```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady);

function onDeviceReady() {

    const state = {};
    function setState(attr) {
        Object.assign(state, attr);
        render(state);
    }

    setState({
        error: '',
        status: 'Loading...',
        product1: {},
        product2: {},
    });

    // We will initialize the in-app purchase plugin here.

    function render() {

        const body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
        body.innerHTML = `
<pre> 
${state.error}

subscription: ${state.status}
</pre>
        `;
    }
}
```

Now let's initialize the in-app purchase plugin, where indicated in the `onDeviceReady` function.

```javascript

    // We should first register all our products or we cannot use them in the app.
    store.register([{
        id:    'my_subscription1',
        type:   CdvPurchase.ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION,
    }, {
        id:    'my_subscription2',
        type:   CdvPurchase.ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION,
    }]);

    // Setup the receipt validator service.
    store.validator = '<<< YOUR_RECEIPT_VALIDATION_URL >>>';

    // Show errors for 10 seconds.
    store.error(function(error) {
        setState({ error: `ERROR ${error.code}: ${error.message}` });
        setTimeout(function() {
            setState({ error: `` });
        }, 10000);
    });

    // Later, we will add our events handlers here

    // Load informations about products and purchases
    store.refresh();
}
```

Here's a little explanation:

We start by registering the product with ID `my_subscription1` and `my_subscription2`.

We declare the products as renewable subscriptions \(`CdvPurchase.ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION`\). [⇒ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#registering-products).

We setup the link to the receipt validation server. If you're using [Fovea.Billing](https://billing.fovea.cc), you'll [find it here](https://billing-dashboard.fovea.cc/setup/cordova).

We setup an error handler. It will display the last error message for 10 seconds on top of the screen.

Finally, we perform the initial `refresh()` of all product states. [⇒ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#registering-products).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whatever your setup is, you should make sure the initialization code is executed as soon as the javascript application starts. You have to be ready to handle IAP events as soon as possible.
{% endhint %}

### Presentation

Let's now display the subscription status, as it is provided by the native platform. Before the call to `store.refresh()` we will add an handler for the `update` event:

This hander is called whenever there's a change in our products' state.

```javascript
// Called when any subscription product is updated
store.when('subscription').updated(function() {
    const product1 = store.get('my_subscription1') || {};
    const product2 = store.get('my_subscription2') || {};

    let status = 'Please subscribe below';
    if (product1.owned || product2.owned)
        status = 'Subscribed';
    else if (product1.state === 'approved' || product2.state === 'approved')
        status = 'Processing...';

    setState({ product1, product2, status });
});
```

Now we can display some information about our products from the `render()` function:

```javascript
function render() {

    const purchaseProduct1 = '';
    const purchaseProduct2 = '';

    const body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0];
    body.innerHTML = `
<pre> 
${state.error}

subscription: ${state.status}

id:     ${state.product1.id          || ''}
title:  ${state.product1.title       || ''}
state:  ${state.product1.state       || ''}
descr:  ${state.product1.description || ''}
price:  ${state.product1.price       || ''}
expiry: ${state.product1.expiryDate  || ''}
</pre>
${purchaseProduct1}
<pre>

id:     ${state.product2.id          || ''}
title:  ${state.product2.title       || ''}
descr:  ${state.product2.description || ''}
price:  ${state.product2.price       || ''}
state:  ${state.product2.state       || ''}
expiry: ${state.product2.expiryDate  || ''}
</pre>
${purchaseProduct2}
    `;
}
```

Whenever anything happens to our product, the interface will now be updated to reflect the current state.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Displaying your product information this way, i.e. exactly as loaded from the Store, is required by Apple and Google. Do otherwise and they might simply reject your application.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="hint" %}
You can also disconnect the event handler with `store.off()` so your subscription view is only updated when it's visible.
{% endhint %}

If you want a bit more background information about all of this, please check the introduction's [displaying products](../discover/about-the-plugin.md#displaying-products) section and the [⇒ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#storeproduct-object) for full details about the fields found for a product.

### Purchase

So far so good, but what if we could actually initiate a purchase? To do so, we'll add a purchase button for both products. We already added placeholders for the purchase buttons, let's create them. Before displaying a purchase button, we need to make sure the user can actually purchase the item. It could be impossible for a few reasons: there's already a purchase in progress, the product is already owned, the feature is disabled for the user (Child Mode).

In our `render()` function, we update the code that initialized `purchaseProduct1` and `purchaseProduct2`.

```javascript
// button for product 1
const purchaseProduct1 = state.product1.canPurchase
    ? `<button onclick="store.order('my_subscription1')">Subscribe</button>` : '';

// same for product 2
const purchaseProduct2 = state.product2.canPurchase
    ? `<button onclick="store.order('my_subscription2')">Subscribe</button>` : '';
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
    The buy button should only be displayed when `product.canPurchase` is true. Otherwise, calling `store.order()` will generate an error.
{% endhint %}

We could make this a little nicer by changing the button labels to "Upgrade" or "Downgrade" when the other product is `owned`, I will leave this as an exercise to the reader.

Now, let's build and test!

### Extra step for Android

If using the [Fovea validation service](https://billing.fovea.cc/), `expiryDate` and some other features of the API for an auto-renewing Android subscription will only be available if you complete the _"Connect With Google"_ step using the explainer [here](https://billing.fovea.cc/documentation/connect-with-google-publisher-api/).

*Note: The reliability of fields like `expiryDate` and `owned` status heavily depends on using a receipt validator connected to the Google Play Developer API.*

### Purchase Flow

Finally, we handle the purchase events for subscriptions. This requires verification and acknowledging the purchase.
*   Initiate the order when the "Subscribe" button is clicked. Consider handling upgrades/downgrades using `additionalData` if products are in the same `group` or by specifying `oldPurchaseToken`.
*   Verify the transaction with the receipt validator upon approval using `transaction.verify()`.
*   Acknowledge the purchase by calling `receipt.finish()` (or `transaction.finish()`) once verified. This is crucial to prevent automatic refunds and ensures proper subscription state management by Google Play.


### Testing

To test on Android with In-App Purchases enabled, I always chose to run my app through Android Studio. This way, I can see the logs from both the javascript and native sides, which is useful.

To create a build, first update the Android project on the console, run

```text
cordova prepare android
```

Run.

![](.gitbook/assets/subscribe-init.png)

### Purchase Flow

We already added a "Buy" button. This button calls the `store.order()` method which initiates the purchase flow for a product.

At this point, the code starts the process but the purchase will remain "processing" forever, in the `approved` state.

For a product in the `approved` state, the transaction has been approved by the user's banking institurion but it won't be finalized until you inform them to do so. You have to deliver whatever the user purchased before finalizing.

I already introduced the purchase flow in the introduction of this guide, you can check the [purchase process](../discover/about-the-plugin.md#purchase-process) section if you need a refresher. The official documentation provides even more details. [⇒ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#-purchasing) 

When the user is done with the native interface (i.e. has entered his/her password and confirmed\), your app receives the `approved` event. So let's add more handlers to the `onDeviceReady()` function, before the call to `store.refresh()`.

```javascript
store.when()
     .approved(p => p.verify())
     .verified(p => p.finish())
     .owned(p => console.log(`you now own ${p.alias}`));
```

That's enough for a local implementation (where we don't need to inform a server of changes to the subscription status). Let's try the whole thing now. Repeat the steps from the [testing](#testing) section above:

```text
cordova prepare android
```

Run from Android Studio and here you go! You should be able to purchase your subscriptions.
