When you only require iOS support, no need for special command line arguments:

```text
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-purchase
```

You then have to activate the In-App Purchase capability manually for your application using Xcode. Unfortunately it's not something the plugin can do automatically. So let's first prepare the iOS project:

```text
$ cordova prepare ios
```

Then open the project on Xcode:

```text
$ open platforms/ios/*.xcodeproj
```

Get to the project's settings by clicking on the project's icon, which is the top-most item in the left-side pane tree view.

Select the target, go to _Capabilities_, scroll down to _In-App Purchase_ and make sure it's **"ON".**

Now try to **build the app from Xcode**. It might point you to a few stuff it might automatically fix for you if you're starting from a fresh project, like selecting a development team and creating the signing certificate. So just let Xcode do that for you except if you have a good reason not to and know what you're doing.

Successful build? You're good to go!
