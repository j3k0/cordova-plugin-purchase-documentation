We will proceed in 4 steps: setup, initialization, presentation and purchase.

Here what we'll do.

1. Install Dependencies
2. Create Cordova Project
3. Setup AppStore Application
4. Install and Prepare with XCode
5. Create In-App Products
6. Prepare Test Accounts

Of couse you can skip the first few steps if you already have a working application you want to integrate the code into.

Once we have a Cordova iOS application with IAP support enabled and everything is in place on AppStore Connect, we will get into some coding.

1. Initialize the in-app purchase plugin
2. Handle the purchase events
3. Deliver our product
4. Secure the transactions
