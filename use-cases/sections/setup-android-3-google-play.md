Make sure we have a Google Play application created and configured.

### Create the App

* Open the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
* Click "Create Application", fill in the required fields.

Need more help? I recommend you check [Google's own documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469?hl=en&ref_topic=7072031). It's well detailed, easy to follow and probably the most up-to-date resource you can find.

### Retrieve the Billing Key

We need to inform the plugin of our app's `BILLING_KEY`. That piece of information can be found on the Google Play Publisher Console.

So head again to your [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).

In the "_All Applications_" menu, go to the application you want to setup. In my case "_Cordova Purchase Demo_".

From there, find the "_Monetization setup_" section \(on the left-side panel\).

Under **Licensing**, you'll find this long Base64-encoded string (an RSA public key). Keep it around for later reference. That's your **Billing Key**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Billing Key will be required to install the plugin on Android and setup receipt validation.
