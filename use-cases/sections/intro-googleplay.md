We will proceed in steps: setup, initialization, presentation and purchase.

First some setup.

1. Install NodeJS and Cordova
2. Setup your Cordova project
3. Prepare an Application on Google Play
4. Install the In-App Purchases plugin
5. Build a Release APK
6. Create a Product on Google Play
7. Upload a Release APK to Google Play
8. Prepare Test Accounts

Of course you can skip the first few steps if you already have a working application you want to integrate the code into.

Once we have a Cordova application with IAP support enabled and everything is in place on Google Play, we will get into some coding.

1. Initialize the in-app purchase plugin
2. Handle the purchase events
3. Deliver our product
4. Secure the transactions
