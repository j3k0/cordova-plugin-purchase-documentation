To install the plugin, we will use the usual `cordova plugin add` command.

```text
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-purchase"
```

Now let's try to build.

```text
cordova build android
```

Successful build?

```text
[...]
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
```

All good! Seems like we can build an app with support for the Billing API.

Let's now prepare a release APK.
