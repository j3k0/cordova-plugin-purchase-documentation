Once you have built your release APK, you need to upload it to Google Play in order to be able to test In-App Purchases. In-App Purchase is not enabled in "debug build". In order to test in-app purchase, your APK needs to be signed with your release signing key. In order for Google to know your release signing key for this application, you need to upload a release APK:

* Signed with this key.
* Have the BILLING permission enabled
  * it is done when you add the plugin to your project, so make sure you didn't skip this step.

Google already provides [detailed resource on how to upload a release build](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011). What we want here is to:

1. create an **internal testing release**
2. **upload** it
3. **publish** it \(privately probably\).

Once you went over those steps, you can test your app with in-app purchase enabled without uploading to Google Play each time, but you need to sign the APK with the same "release" signing key.

Note that it might up to 24 hours for your IAP to work after you uploaded the first release APK.
