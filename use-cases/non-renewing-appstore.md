# Non-Renewing Subscription for iOS & macOS



# Non-Renewing Subscription on iOS & macOS

This guide demonstrates how to implement a **non-renewing subscription** product using the AppStore platform for iOS and macOS applications.

Non-renewing subscriptions grant access to content or services for a **fixed, limited duration** (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year). Unlike auto-renewing subscriptions, they **do not automatically renew** at the end of the period. The user must explicitly purchase the subscription again to extend access.

Key characteristics on Apple platforms:

*   Managed entirely by your application logic after the initial purchase.
*   Apple does not handle renewals, cancellations, or expiry notifications automatically.
*   Often used for time-limited access to content archives, seasonal passes, or services where auto-renewal isn't desired or appropriate.
*   Requires careful handling of expiry dates and potentially syncing purchase status across devices if you support user accounts.

In this guide, we will build a simple application that allows users to purchase a non-renewing subscription which grants access for a defined period.
## Setup for iOS AppStore

**Platform Interfaces Change Frequently!**

The App Store Connect interface and Apple's requirements change often. This guide provides a general overview but may become outdated.

**Always refer to the official Apple documentation as the primary source:**
*   [App Store Connect Help](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/)
*   [In-App Purchase Configuration](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-in-app-purchase-settings/overview-for-configuring-in-app-purchases)
{% endhint %}

This section covers the essential steps for setting up your iOS/macOS app for In-App Purchases with the Cordova plugin.

### 1. Install Dependencies


Needless to say, make sure you have the tools installed on your machine. During the writing of this guide, I've been using the following environment:

* **NodeJS** v10.12.0
* **Cordova** v8.1.2
* **macOS** 10.14.1

I'm not saying it won't work with different version. If you start fresh, it might be a good idea to use an up-to-date environment.


### 2. Create Cordova Project

#### Create the project

If it isn't already created:

```text
$ cordova create CordovaProject cc.fovea.purchase.demo PurchaseNC
Creating a new cordova project.
```

For details about what those parameters are:

```text
$ cordova help create
```

Note, feel free to pick a different project ID and name. Remember whatever values you put in here.

Let's head into our cordova project's directory \(should match whatever we used in the previous step.

```text
$ cd CordovaProject
```
#### Add iOS platform

```text
$ cordova platform add ios
```


### 3. Setup AppStore Application & Agreements

*   **Apple Developer Account:** Ensure you have an active Apple Developer Program membership.
*   **App Record:** Create an App Record for your application in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com).
*   **Agreements, Tax, and Banking:** Ensure all agreements are accepted and banking/tax information is complete in the "Agreements, Tax, and Banking" section of App Store Connect. Your app won't be able to process purchases otherwise.
*   **Bundle ID:** Verify the Bundle ID in App Store Connect exactly matches the `id` in your `config.xml`.


First, I assume you have an Apple developer account. If not time to register, because it's mandatory.

Let's now head to the [AppStore Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) website. In order to start developing and testing In-App Purchases, you need all contracts in place as well as your financial information setup. Make sure there are no warning left there.

I'll not guide you through the whole procedure, just create setup your Apple application as usual.

#### Retrieve the Shared Secret

Since you are here, let's retrieve the Shared Secret. You can use an App-Specific one or a Master Shared Secret, at your convenience: both will work. Keep the value around, it'll be required, especially if you are implementing subscriptions.

### 4. Install and Prepare with XCode


When you only require iOS support, no need for special command line arguments:

```text
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-purchase
```

You then have to activate the In-App Purchase capability manually for your application using Xcode. Unfortunately it's not something the plugin can do automatically. So let's first prepare the iOS project:

```text
$ cordova prepare ios
```

Then open the project on Xcode:

```text
$ open platforms/ios/*.xcodeproj
```

Get to the project's settings by clicking on the project's icon, which is the top-most item in the left-side pane tree view.

Select the target, go to _Capabilities_, scroll down to _In-App Purchase_ and make sure it's **"ON".**

![Enabling In-App Purchase Capability in Xcode](../.gitbook/assets/xcode-iap-capability.png)

Now try to **build the app from Xcode**. It might point you to a few stuff it might automatically fix for you if you're starting from a fresh project, like selecting a development team and creating the signing certificate. So just let Xcode do that for you except if you have a good reason not to and know what you're doing.

Successful build? You're good to go!


### 5. Create In-App Products

### 5. Create In-App Products

If you followed the [Setup AppStore Application](#3-setup-appstore-application) section, you should have everything setup. Head again to the App's In-App Purchases page: select your application, then _Features_, then _In-App Purchases_.

From there you can create your In-App Products. Select the appropriate type, fill in all required metadata and select _cleared for sale_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if that sounds stupid, you need to fill-in ALL metadata in order to use the In-App Product in development, even the screenshot for reviewers. Make sure you have at least one localization in place too.
{% endhint %}

The process is well explained by Apple, so I'll not enter into more details.


### 6. Create Test Users

### 6. Create Test Users

In order to test your In-App Purchases during development, you should create some test users.

You can do so from the AppStore Connect website, in the _Users & Access_ section. There in the sidebar, you should see "Sandbox > Testers". If you don't, it means you don't have enough permissions to create sandbox testers, so ask your administrator.

From there, it's just a matter of hitting "+" and filling the form. While you're at it, create 2-3 test users: it will be handy for testing.

## Code Implementation

This section describes the minimal code required to implement a non-renewing subscription product (granting access for a fixed period) on iOS and macOS using the AppStore platform.

### Base framework

First, let's set up the basic HTML structure and the initial JavaScript to load the plugin.


#### index.html

Assuming you're starting from a blank project, we'll add the minimal amount of HTML for the purpose of this tutorial. Let's replace the `<body>` from the `www/index.html` file with the below.

```markup
<body>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

Let's also make sure to comment out Cordova template project's CSS.

You also need to enable the `'unsafe-inline'` `Content-Security-Policy` by adding it to the `default-src` section:

```markup
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' [...]" />
```

You can download the [full index.html file here](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/80c69837e5bacf83c4fc2320ba2e5dc2).
#### javascript


We will now create a new JavaScript file and load it from the HTML. The code below will initialize the plugin.

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady);

function onDeviceReady() {

  if (!window.CdvPurchase) {
      console.log('CdvPurchase is not available');
      return;
  }
  const {store} = CdvPurchase;

  store.error(function(error) {
      console.log('ERROR ' + error.code + ': ' + error.message);
  });

  store.ready(function() {
    console.log("CdvPurchase is ready");
  });
 
  initializeStore();
  refreshUI();
}

function initializeStore() {
  // We will implement this soon
}

function refreshUI() {
  // Soon...
}
```
{% endcode %}

Here's a little explanation:

**Line 1**, it's important to wait for the "deviceready" event before using cordova plugins.

**Lines 5-8**, we check if the plugin was correctly loaded.

**Lines 11-13**, we setup an error handler. It just logs errors to the console.

> Whatever your setup is, you should make sure this runs as soon as the javascript application starts. You have to be ready to handle IAP events as soon as possible.

### Initialization & Presentation

Now, we'll initialize the plugin, register our non-renewing subscription product, and set up the UI to display its status and purchase options. This involves:
*   Registering the product with type `NON_RENEWING_SUBSCRIPTION`.
*   Displaying product details (title, description, price, duration).
*   Displaying the current access expiry date if the subscription is active. *Your application needs to calculate and store this based on purchase history.*
*   Showing a "Subscribe" or "Extend" button. Non-renewing subscriptions can typically be purchased multiple times to extend access.

### Initialization & UI Setup (Subscriptions)

This section guides you through setting up the initial HTML and JavaScript required to initialize the purchase plugin, register your subscription products, configure a validator (essential for subscriptions), and display product information and subscription status before handling the actual purchase flow.

**Step 1: Basic HTML Structure**

*   **What:** Set up `www/index.html` with placeholders for subscription status, the list of available subscription products, error messages, and management buttons.
*   **Why:** Provides the necessary structure to display dynamic information about subscriptions to the user.

```markup
<!-- www/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' https://validator.iaptic.com 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' gap:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *">
  <!-- IMPORTANT: Replace https://validator.iaptic.com with YOUR actual validator host -->
</head>
<body style="margin-top: 50px">
  <div class="app">
    <h1>Subscription Service</h1>
    <p id="subscription-status">Subscription Status: Loading...</p>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Available Plans</h2>
    <div id="subscription-products">
      <p>Loading subscription plans...</p>
    </div>
    <hr/>
    <div id="management-buttons">
      <!-- Buttons like Restore, Manage will go here -->
    </div>
    <!-- Placeholder for error messages -->
    <div id="error-display" style="color: red; margin-top: 10px;"></div>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

*   **Important:** Update the `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag to allow connections to your receipt validation server. Replace `https://validator.iaptic.com` if you use a different service or host your own. Add `'unsafe-inline'` if using `onclick`.

**Step 2: Initial JavaScript Framework**

*   **What:** Create `www/js/index.js` with the basic structure, waiting for `deviceready`.
*   **Why:** Ensures the plugin is loaded before we attempt to use it.

```javascript
// www/js/index.js

// Wait for Cordova to be ready
document.addEventListener('deviceready', initializeStore);

// Basic state holder (optional, but helps manage UI updates)
let appState = {
  products: [], // Will hold loaded CdvPurchase.Product objects
  activeSubscription: null, // Will hold the active CdvPurchase.VerifiedPurchase object
  status: 'Loading...',
  error: '',
};

// Helper function to update state and trigger UI refresh
function setState(update) {
  Object.assign(appState, update);
  renderUI(); // We'll define renderUI soon
}

function initializeStore() {
    console.log('Device is ready, initializing store for subscriptions...');

    if (!window.CdvPurchase || !window.CdvPurchase.store) {
        console.error('Store plugin not available');
        setState({ error: 'Store plugin failed to load.', status: 'Setup Error' });
        return;
    }

    const { store, ProductType, Platform, LogLevel } = CdvPurchase;
    console.log('Store plugin version: ' + store.version);

    // Optional: Set log level for debugging
    store.verbosity = LogLevel.DEBUG;

    // --- We will add subsequent steps here ---
    // 1. Register Products
    // 2. Configure Validator (Essential for Subscriptions)
    // 3. Setup Error Handling
    // 4. Setup Event Listeners
    // 5. Initialize the Store
}

// --- UI Rendering Function ---
function renderUI() {
    console.log('Rendering UI with current state:', appState);
    // (Implementation in Step 6)
}

// --- Action Functions (stubs for now) ---
// window.subscribe = function(productId, platform, offerId) { ... };
// window.restoreSubs = function() { ... };
```

**Step 3: Register Subscription Products**

*   **What:** Tell the plugin about your subscription products using `store.register()`. Specify `ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION`.
*   **Why:** The plugin needs to know which products to manage and fetch details for. Use the optional `group` property if you have different subscription tiers (e.g., 'bronze', 'gold') to enable platform-managed upgrades/downgrades where supported.

Add this inside `initializeStore`:

```javascript
// Inside initializeStore()

// 1. Register Products
console.log('Registering subscription products...');
// Replace with your actual product IDs and platforms
store.register([{
    id: 'subscription1', // e.g., 'myapp.monthly.premium'
    type: ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION,
    platform: store.defaultPlatform(), // Or specific platform like Platform.GOOGLE_PLAY
    group: 'premium' // Optional: Group subscriptions for upgrade/downgrade paths
}, {
    id: 'subscription2', // e.g., 'myapp.yearly.premium'
    type: ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION,
    platform: store.defaultPlatform(),
    group: 'premium' // Same group as the monthly one
}]);
```

**Step 4: Configure the Validator (Crucial for Subscriptions)**

*   **What:** Set the `store.validator` property to your receipt validation service URL or function.
*   **Why:** Subscriptions require server-side validation to accurately track expiry dates, renewal status, cancellations, grace periods, etc. Local device receipts are often insufficient or unreliable for this. **Do not skip this step for subscriptions.**

Add this inside `initializeStore`:

```javascript
// Inside initializeStore()

// 2. Configure Validator (Essential for Subscriptions)
console.log('Configuring validator...');
// Replace with your actual validation URL (e.g., from Iaptic or your own server)
store.validator = "https://validator.iaptic.com/v1/validate?appName=YOUR_APP&apiKey=YOUR_KEY";
if (store.validator.includes("YOUR_APP")) {
  const msg = "VALIDATOR NOT CONFIGURED. Replace YOUR_APP and YOUR_KEY in js/index.js.";
  console.warn(msg);
  setState({ error: msg, status: 'Setup Error' });
  // Consider preventing further actions if validator isn't set up
  // return;
}
```

**Step 5: Setup Error Handling**

*   **What:** Use `store.error()` to catch general plugin errors.
*   **Why:** Provides essential feedback for debugging and user information.

Add this inside `initializeStore`:

```javascript
// Inside initializeStore()

// 3. Setup Error Handling
console.log('Setting up error handler...');
store.error(function(error) {
    console.error('STORE ERROR ' + error.code + ': ' + error.message);
    setState({ error: `Error: ${error.message} (Code: ${error.code})` });
    // Optionally clear the error after a delay
    setTimeout(() => { if (appState.error === `Error: ${error.message} (Code: ${error.code})`) setState({ error: '' }); }, 10000);
});
```

**Step 6: Implement UI Rendering (`renderUI`)**

*   **What:** Create the `renderUI` function. It should display the overall subscription status (derived from verified purchases) and the details of each available subscription product, including a "Subscribe" button if appropriate.
*   **Why:** Shows the user their current status and available options.

Replace the placeholder `renderUI` function with this:

```javascript
// In js/index.js

function renderUI() {
    console.log('Rendering UI with current state:', appState);
    const { store, ProductType, Platform, RecurrenceMode, PaymentMode, Utils } = CdvPurchase; // Import necessary types/enums

    const statusEl = document.getElementById('subscription-status');
    const productsEl = document.getElementById('subscription-products');
    const errorEl = document.getElementById('error-display');
    const managementEl = document.getElementById('management-buttons');

    if (!statusEl || !productsEl || !errorEl || !managementEl) {
        console.error("Required UI elements not found!");
        return;
    }

    // Display Error
    errorEl.textContent = appState.error || '';

    // Determine Active Subscription Status from *verified* receipts
    // This requires a validator. Without it, this logic needs adjustment.
    const activeSub = store.verifiedPurchases.find(p => {
        const product = store.get(p.id, p.platform);
        // Check if it's a subscription type AND not expired
        return product?.type === ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION && !p.isExpired;
    });
    appState.activeSubscription = activeSub; // Store for potential reuse

    let statusMessage = 'Not Subscribed';
    if (activeSub) {
        const expiry = activeSub.expiryDate ? new Date(activeSub.expiryDate).toLocaleDateString() : 'N/A';
        const productName = store.get(activeSub.id, activeSub.platform)?.title ?? activeSub.id;
        statusMessage = `Subscribed to ${productName} (Expires: ${expiry})`;
        if (activeSub.renewalIntent === 'Lapse') statusMessage += ' - Will Not Renew';
        if (activeSub.isTrialPeriod) statusMessage += ' (Trial)';
        if (activeSub.isBillingRetryPeriod) statusMessage += ' (Billing Issue!)';
    } else {
        // Check for the latest expired subscription to inform the user
        const latestExpired = store.verifiedPurchases
            .filter(p => store.get(p.id, p.platform)?.type === ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION && p.isExpired)
            .sort((a, b) => (b.expiryDate ?? 0) - (a.expiryDate ?? 0))[0]; // Get the most recently expired
        if (latestExpired) {
            const expiry = latestExpired.expiryDate ? new Date(latestExpired.expiryDate).toLocaleDateString() : 'N/A';
            statusMessage = `Subscription expired on ${expiry}. Please resubscribe.`;
        }
    }
    statusEl.textContent = `Subscription Status: ${statusMessage}`;

    // Render Subscription Products
    productsEl.innerHTML = store.products
        .filter(p => p.type === ProductType.PAID_SUBSCRIPTION) // Show only subscriptions
        .map(product => {
            let productHtml = `<div><h4>${product.title || product.id}</h4>`;
            if (product.description) productHtml += `<p>${product.description}</p>`;

            if (product.offers && product.offers.length > 0) {
                product.offers.forEach(offer => {
                    productHtml += `<div style="margin-left: 10px; border-left: 2px solid #ccc; padding-left: 10px;">`;
                    const priceDetails = offer.pricingPhases.map(phase => {
                        let phaseDesc = `${phase.price}`;
                        if (phase.billingPeriod) {
                           phaseDesc += ` / ${Utils.formatDurationEN(phase.billingPeriod, { omitOne: true })}`;
                        }
                        if (phase.paymentMode === PaymentMode.FREE_TRIAL) {
                            phaseDesc = `Free Trial for ${Utils.formatDurationEN(phase.billingPeriod)}`;
                        } else if (phase.paymentMode === PaymentMode.PAY_AS_YOU_GO && phase.recurrenceMode === RecurrenceMode.FINITE_RECURRING) {
                            phaseDesc += ` (for ${phase.billingCycles} cycles)`;
                        } else if (phase.paymentMode === PaymentMode.UP_FRONT && phase.billingPeriod) {
                             phaseDesc = `${phase.price} for ${Utils.formatDurationEN(phase.billingPeriod)}`;
                        }
                        return phaseDesc;
                    }).join(' then ');

                    productHtml += `<p><strong>Offer:</strong> ${priceDetails}</p>`;

                    // Button logic:
                    // Show "Subscribe" only if:
                    // 1. There's no active subscription at all OR
                    // 2. There IS an active subscription, BUT it's NOT for this product AND they are in the same group (upgrade/downgrade)
                    // 3. The offer can actually be purchased
                    const isCurrentActiveSub = activeSub && activeSub.id === product.id && activeSub.platform === product.platform;
                    const canUpgradeDowngrade = activeSub && !isCurrentActiveSub && product.group && store.get(activeSub.id, activeSub.platform)?.group === product.group;

                    if ((!activeSub || canUpgradeDowngrade) && offer.canPurchase) {
                        const buttonLabel = canUpgradeDowngrade ? 'Switch Plan' : 'Subscribe';
                        productHtml += `<button onclick="window.subscribe('${product.id}', '${product.platform}', '${offer.id}')">${buttonLabel}</button>`;
                    } else if (isCurrentActiveSub) {
                        productHtml += '<p><em>(Currently Active)</em></p>';
                    } else {
                        productHtml += '<p><em>(Cannot purchase)</em></p>';
                    }
                    productHtml += `</div>`; // Close offer div
                });
            } else {
                productHtml += '<p>Pricing information not available.</p>';
            }
            productHtml += `</div>`; // Close product div
            return productHtml;
        }).join('<hr/>');

    // Render Management Buttons
    managementEl.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous
    const currentPlatform = activeSub?.platform ?? store.defaultPlatform();
    if (store.checkSupport(currentPlatform, 'manageSubscriptions')) {
        managementEl.innerHTML += `<button onclick="CdvPurchase.store.manageSubscriptions('${currentPlatform}')">Manage Subscription</button> `;
    }
    if (store.checkSupport(currentPlatform, 'manageBilling')) {
        managementEl.innerHTML += `<button onclick="CdvPurchase.store.manageBilling('${currentPlatform}')">Manage Billing</button> `;
    }
    if (store.checkSupport(currentPlatform, 'restorePurchases')) {
         managementEl.innerHTML += `<button onclick="window.restoreSubs()">Restore Purchases</button>`;
    }
}
```

**Step 7: Setup Event Listeners**

*   **What:** Listen for product and receipt updates using `store.when()`.
*   **Why:** To keep the UI synchronized with the latest data fetched from the stores and the validator.

Add this inside `initializeStore`:

```javascript
// Inside initializeStore()

// 4. Setup Event Listeners
console.log('Setting up event listeners...');
store.when()
    .productUpdated(product => {
        console.log("Product updated: " + product.id);
        // Find and update the product in our local state (appState.products)
        const index = appState.products.findIndex(p => p.id === product.id && p.platform === product.platform);
        if (index >= 0) appState.products[index] = product;
        else appState.products.push(product);
        renderUI(); // Refresh the whole UI
    })
    .receiptUpdated(() => {
        console.log("Receipt updated (local)");
        // Re-render to potentially update purchase/owned status based on local data
        renderUI();
    })
    .verified(() => {
        console.log("Receipt verified");
        // Re-render to update purchase/owned status based on verified data
        renderUI();
    });
    // We will add .approved() and .finished() handlers in the platform-specific
    // purchase flow sections.
```

**Step 8: Initialize the Store**

*   **What:** Call `store.initialize()` to start the plugin.
*   **Why:** Activates the registered platforms and begins loading product/purchase data.

Add this at the *end* of `initializeStore`:

```javascript
// Inside initializeStore()

// 5. Initialize the Store
console.log('Initializing store plugin...');
store.initialize([store.defaultPlatform()]) // Add other platforms if needed
    .then(() => {
        console.log("Store initialized successfully.");
        // Initial UI render after initialization attempt
        renderUI();
    })
    .catch(err => {
        console.error("Store initialization failed", err);
        setState({ error: 'Failed to initialize store.', status: 'Error' });
    });
```

**Step 9: Prepare Action Function Stubs**

*   **What:** Define the global functions (`window.subscribe`, `window.restoreSubs`) that the UI buttons will call.
*   **Why:** Provides the necessary functions for the `onclick` handlers. The actual logic will be implemented in the platform-specific purchase flow guides.

```javascript
// In js/index.js (add these function definitions)

// Make functions globally accessible for button onclick handlers
window.subscribe = function(productId, platform, offerId) {
    console.log(`Subscribe button clicked for ${productId} on ${platform}, offer ${offerId}`);
    const { store } = CdvPurchase;
    const offer = store.get(productId, platform)?.getOffer(offerId);

    if (offer) {

This sets up the generic part for handling subscriptions. The UI will now display product information and subscription status based on *verified* data (once available). The next steps involve implementing the purchase flow (`store.order` call within `window.subscribe`, and the `.approved()`, `.verified()`, `.finished()` handlers) specific to either the App Store or Google Play.
*Note: Adapt the UI logic in `subscription-generic-initialization.md`. The concept of `product.owned` is less relevant here; you need to track ownership and expiry based on purchase history (likely stored locally or synced via your backend). Show "Access until [Your Calculated Expiry Date]".*

### Purchase Flow

Handling the purchase flow for non-renewing subscriptions on Apple platforms involves purchasing the product and then managing the entitlement period within your application.
*   Initiate the order when the "Subscribe/Extend" button is clicked.
*   Handle the `approved` state. Verification is optional but recommended for tracking purchase history reliably.
*   Call `transaction.finish()` once the purchase is approved (or verified).
*   Your application must record the purchase time and calculate the expiry date based on the product's defined duration (e.g., 1 month, 1 year).
*   Store this expiry date persistently (e.g., `localStorage`, secure storage, or synced with your backend).
*   Implement logic to check the expiry date to grant or deny access to the content/service.
*   If you support user accounts, you need to sync this entitlement across the user's devices.

### Purchase Flow (iOS/macOS Non-Renewing)

Handling the purchase flow for non-renewing subscriptions on Apple platforms involves purchasing the product like any other, acknowledging it, and then managing the entitlement period within your application logic. Apple does not automatically track the expiry or renewal for this type of subscription.

1.  **Initiate Order:**
    When the user clicks the "Subscribe" or "Extend" button, call `store.order()` on the relevant offer.

    ```javascript
    function purchaseNonRenewingSubscription() {
        const offer = store.get('my_non_renewing_sub_id', Platform.APPLE_APPSTORE)?.getOffer();
        if (offer) {
            store.order(offer)
                .then(result => {
                    if (result && result.isError) {
                        // Handle error (e.g., payment cancelled)
                        console.error("Order failed: " + result.message);
                    } else {
                        // Optional: Update UI to show processing state if needed
                        console.log("Order successful, waiting for approval/verification.");
                    }
                });
        } else {
            console.error("Offer not found for non-renewing subscription.");
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **Handle Approval & Verification (Optional but Recommended):**
    Set up listeners for the `approved` and `verified` states. Verification is useful for obtaining the `purchaseDate` accurately from Apple's servers, which you'll need to calculate the expiry.

    ```javascript
    // In your store initialization (e.g., inside onDeviceReady or initStore)
    store.when()
        .approved(transaction => {
            // Optional: Verify the transaction to get accurate purchaseDate
            // and confirm legitimacy.
            if (store.validator) {
                transaction.verify();
            } else {
                // No validator, proceed directly to finish/acknowledge
                // Note: transaction.purchaseDate might be less reliable without validation.
                acknowledgePurchase(transaction);
            }
        })
        .verified(receipt => {
            // Acknowledgment is done after verification succeeds
            const transaction = receipt.transactions.find(t => t.products[0]?.id === 'my_non_renewing_sub_id'); // Find the relevant transaction
            if (transaction) {
                acknowledgePurchase(transaction);
            }
        });
    ```

3.  **Acknowledge (Finish) the Purchase & Calculate Expiry:**
    Call `transaction.finish()` to acknowledge the purchase with Apple. Crucially, you must then calculate and store the expiry date based on the product's defined duration and the transaction's `purchaseDate`.

    ```javascript
    function acknowledgePurchase(transaction) {
        // Grant entitlement based on the product purchased
        // 1. Get the accurate purchase date (ideally from verified receipt if possible)
        const purchaseDate = transaction.purchaseDate || new Date(); // Fallback to now if date missing

        // 2. Determine the duration from your product definition
        const productDurationMonths = 6; // Example: Get this (e.g., 6 months) based on transaction.products[0].id

        // 3. Calculate expiry date
        const expiryDate = new Date(purchaseDate);
        expiryDate.setMonth(expiryDate.getMonth() + productDurationMonths);

        // 4. Store the expiry date persistently and associate with the user/device
        //    This might involve localStorage, secure storage, or your backend.
        //    If syncing across devices, ensure this is tied to the user's account.
        window.localStorage.setItem('nonRenewingExpiry_' + transaction.products[0].id, expiryDate.toISOString());
        console.log(`Access granted for ${transaction.products[0].id} until: ${expiryDate.toISOString()}`);

        // 5. Acknowledge the purchase with Apple AppStore
        transaction.finish();

        // 6. Refresh UI to show the new expiry date
        refreshUI(); // Ensure your refreshUI reads the stored expiry date
    }
    ```

4.  **Manage Entitlement:**
    Your application must check the stored expiry date whenever the user tries to access the protected content or service. Sync this state if users can log into accounts on multiple devices.

    ```javascript
    function hasActiveNonRenewingAccess(productId) {
        const expiryString = window.localStorage.getItem('nonRenewingExpiry_' + productId);
        if (!expiryString) return false;
        const expiryDate = new Date(expiryString);
        return expiryDate > new Date();
    }

    // Example usage:
    if (hasActiveNonRenewingAccess('my_non_renewing_sub_id')) {
        // Show premium content
    } else {
        // Show purchase options
    }
    ```

**Key Points:**

*   **Acknowledge:** Always call `transaction.finish()`.
*   **Track Expiry:** Your app *must* calculate, store, and check the expiry date. Apple does not manage this for non-renewing types.
*   **Purchase Date:** Use the `transaction.purchaseDate`. Verification (`transaction.verify()`) provides the most reliable date from Apple's servers.
*   **Persistence & Syncing:** Store the expiry date securely and sync across devices if necessary for your use case.
