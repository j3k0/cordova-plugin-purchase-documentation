# Consumable on Android

In this guide, we will build a small application with a consumable product that works on Android.


We will proceed in steps: setup, initialization, presentation and purchase.

First some setup.

1. Install NodeJS and Cordova
2. Setup your Cordova project
3. Prepare an Application on Google Play
4. Install the In-App Purchases plugin
5. Build a Release APK
6. Create a Product on Google Play
7. Upload a Release APK to Google Play
8. Prepare Test Accounts

Of couse you can skip the first few steps if you already have a working application you want to integrate the code into.

Once we have a Cordova application with IAP support enabled and everything is in place on Google Play, we will get into some coding.

1. Initialize the in-app purchase plugin
2. Handle the purchase events
3. Deliver our product
4. Secure the transactions


## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

Needless to say, make sure you have the tools installed on your machine. Developing from a mac is generally recommended for doing iOS development, it's way easier. If you only plan on doing Android, then everything will work.

During the writing of this guide, I've been using the following environment:

* **NodeJS** v10.12.0
* **Cordova** v8.1.2
* **macOS** 10.14.1

I'm not saying it won't work with different version. If you start fresh, it might be a good idea to use an up-to-date environment.

### 2. Create Cordova Project

Making sure we have a Cordova project that we can build for Android and/or iOS.

#### Create the project

If it isn't already created:

```text
$ cordova create CordovaProject cc.fovea.purchase.demo PurchaseNC
Creating a new cordova project.
```

For details about what those parameters are:

```text
$ cordova help create
```

Note, feel free to pick a different project ID and name. Remember whatever values you put in here.

Let's head into our cordova project's directory \(should match whatever we used in the previous step.

```text
$ cd CordovaProject
```

#### Add Android platform

```text
$ cordova platform add android
```

Will output:

```text
    Using cordova-fetch for cordova-android@~7.1.1
    Adding android project...
    [...]
    Saving android@~7.1.1 into config.xml file ...
```

Let's check if that builds.

```text
$ cordova build android
```

Which outputs:

```text
    Android Studio project detected
    Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)
    [...]
    BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 49s
    Built the following apk(s):
    __EDITED__/platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Alright, seems like we have no problems with our Android build chain. If you do have problems, fixing it is out of scope from this guide but it's required!

### 3. Create Google Play Application

Make sure we have a Google Play application created and configured.

### Create the App

* Open the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).
* Click "Create Application", fill in the required fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
Need more help? I recommend you check [Google's own documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469?hl=en&ref_topic=7072031). It's well detailed, easy to follow and probably the most up-to-date resource you can find.
{% endhint %}

### Retrieve the Billing Key

We need to inform the plugin of our app's `BILLING_KEY`. That piece of information can be found on the Google Play Publisher Console.

So head again to your [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish).

In the "_All Applications_" menu, go to the application you want to setup. In my case "_Cordova Purchase Demo_".

From there, find the "_Monetization setup_" section \(on the left-side panel\).

Under **Licensing**, you'll find this long Base64-encoded string (an RSA public key). Keep it around for later reference. That's your **Billing Key**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Billing Key will be required to install the plugin on Android and setup receipt validation.
{% endhint %}

### 4. Install Cordova Purchase Plugin

To install the plugin, we will use the usual `cordova plugin add` command. There is little subtleties on Android.

When you need Android support, you need to setup your `BILLING_KEY`.

```text
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-purchase --variable BILLING_KEY="<BILLING_KEY>"
```

You can find that piece of information on the Google Play Publisher Console, as [explained here](#retrieve-the-billing-key).

Now let's try to build.

```text
cordova build android
```

Successful build?

```text
[...]
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
```

All good! Seems like we can build an app with support for the Billing API.

Let's now prepare a release APK.

### 5. Android Release APK

To generate a release build, I generally use the following script: [android-release.sh](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/28f60a7d5622508634d09f94c59d6dfc)

The script calls `cordova build android --release` with the correct command line arguments. It requires you have generated a `keystore` file for your application already.

If you haven't generated a keystore file for your application yet, you can use the following command line:

```text
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android-release.keystore -alias release \
-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

I'll ask you a few questions. The only tricky one is "Do you wan't to use the same password for the alias?", the answer is _yes_. Please note that the above command defines the keystore's `alias` as **release**, you can use any value, but just remember the value you chose.

Keep the `android-release.keystore` file in a safe place, backup it everywhere you can! Don't loose it, don't loose the password. You won't EVER be able to update your app on Google Play without it!

Then build.

```text
$ export KEYSTORE_ALIAS=release
$ export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=my_password
$ ./android-release.sh
```

Replace `$KEYSTORE_ALIAS` and `$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with whatever match your those from your `keystore` file...

The output should end with a line like this:

```text
Build is ready:

<SOME_PATH>/android-release-20181015-1145.apk
```

There you go, this is your first release APK.

### 6. Upload to Google Play

Once you have built your release APK, you need to upload it to Google Play in order to be able to test In-App Purchases. In-App Purchase is not enabled in "debug build". In order to test in-app purchase, your APK needs to be signed with your release signing key. In order for Google to know your release signing key for this application, you need to upload a release APK:

* Signed with this key.
* Have the BILLING permission enabled
  * it is done when you add the plugin to your project, so make sure you didn't skip this step.

Google already provides [detailed resource on how to upload a release build](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7159011). What we want here is to:

1. create an **internal testing release**
2. **upload** it
3. **publish** it \(privately probably\).

Once you went over those steps, you can test your app with in-app purchase enabled without uploading to Google Play each time, but you need to sign the APK with the same "release" signing key.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that it might up to 24 hours for your IAP to work after you uploaded the first release APK.
{% endhint %}

### 6. Create In-App Products

There is still a bit more preparatory work: we need to setup our in-app product.

Back in the "Google Play Console", open the "Store presence" â‡’ "In-app products" section.

![](../.gitbook/assets/google-play-in-app-products.png)

If you haven't yet uploaded an APK, it'll warn you that you need to upload a *release* APK.

Once this is done, you can create a product. Google offers 2 kinds of products:

* Managed Products
* Subscriptions

The latest is for auto-renewing subscriptions, in all other cases, you should a "Managed Product".

* Click the **CREATE** button.
* Fill in all the required information \(title, description, prices\).
* Make sure the Status is **ACTIVE**.
* **SAVE**

And we're done!

{% hint style="info" %}
There's might be some delay between creating a product on the Google Play Console and seeing it in your app. If your product doesn't show up after 24h, then you should start to worry.
{% endhint %}

### 8. Prepare Test Accounts

To test your Google Play Billing implementation with actual in-app purchases, you must use a test account. By default, the only test account registered is the one that's associated with your developer account. You can register additional test accounts by using the Google Play Console.

1. Navigate to Settings > Account details.
2. In the License Testing section, add your tester's email addresses to Gmail accounts with testing access field.
3. Save your changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Testers can begin making purchases of your in-app products within 15 minutes.
{% endhint %}


## Coding


### Initialization

Assuming you're starting from a blank project, we'll add the minimal amount of HTML for the purpose of this tutorial. Let's replace the `<body>` from the `www/index.html` file with the below.

```markup
<body>
  <div class="app">
    <p id="gold-coins">Gold:</p>
    <div id="consumable1-purchase">Please wait...</div>
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</body>
```

Let's also make sure to comment out Cordova template project's CSS.

You also need to enable the `'unsafe-inline'` `Content-Security-Policy` by adding it to the `default-src` section:

```markup
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' [...]" />
```

You can download the [full index.html file here](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/3324bb8e759fef4b3054b834a5a88500#file-index-html).

We will now create a new JavaScript file and load it from the HTML. The code below will initialize the plugin.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('deviceready', initStore);

function initStore() {

    if (!window.store) {
        console.log('Store not available');
        return;
    }

    store.register({
        id:    'consumable1',
        alias: 'my_consumable1',
        type:   store.CONSUMABLE
    });

    store.error(function(error) {
        console.log('ERROR ' + error.code + ': ' + error.message);
    });
    
    // ... MORE HERE SOON

    store.refresh();
}
```

Here's a little explanation:

**Lines 5-8**, we check if the plugin is loaded.

**Lines 10-14**, we register the product with ID `consumable1`. We declare it as a consumable \(`store.CONSUMABLE`\). [â‡’ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#registering-products).

**Lines 16-18**, we setup an error handler. It just logs errors to the console.

**Line 22**, we perform the initial `refresh()` of all products states. [â‡’ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#registering-products).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whatever your setup is, you should make sure this runs as soon as the javascript application starts. You have to be ready to handle IAP events as soon as possible.
{% endhint %}

### Presentation

For the sake of this tutorial's simplicity, let's store the user's number of gold coins in localStorage:`window.localStorage.goldCoins`

When the app starts, we'll refresh the `#gold-coins` html element:

```javascript
function refreshGoldCoinsUI() {
    document.getElementById('gold-coins').textContent =
        'GOLD: ' + (window.localStorage.goldCoins | 0);
}

document.addEventListener('deviceready', refreshGoldCoinsUI);
```

This part was easy,. Now for a bit more challenge, let's display the title, description and price of the virtual product for purchasing more gold. `consumable1` that we registered in the initialization code above.

We'll add a little more at `initStore()` function, line 20.

```javascript
store.when('my_consumable1').updated(refreshProductUI);
```

Then define the `refreshProduct()` function at the bottom of the file.

```javascript
function refreshProductUI(product) {
    const info = product.loaded
        ? `title: ${product.title}<br/>` +
          `desc: ${product.description}<br/>` +
          `price: ${product.price}<br/>`
        : 'Retrieving info...';
    const button = product.canPurchase
         ? '<button onclick="purchaseConsumable1()">Buy Now!</button>'
         : '';
    const el = document.getElementById('consumable1-purchase');
    el.htmlContent = info + button;
}
```

**Lines 2**, check if the product has been loaded.

**Lines 3-5**, retrieve and display product informations.

**Lines 7-8**, add the "Buy Now!" button if product can be purchased.

If you want a bit more background information about this, please check the [Displaying Products ](../discover/about-the-plugin.md#displaying-products)section and the [â‡’ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#storeproduct-object) for full details about the fields found for a product.

Let's build and test that!


### Testing

In-App Purchase on Android will only work on release builds, i.e. builds that are signed with the same certificate that the one you're using for APKs you upload on Google Play.

We went over this already, in the [Android Release APK](#5-android-release-apk) section. This is how we're building the release build:

```text
./android-release.sh
```

Feel free to use your own method to create a release APK.

Install the generated APK **on a real device** (important!):

```text
adb install -r path/to/android-release.apk
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
IAP do not work in the emulator!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If needed, you can them access the logs with `adb`, like this:

`adb logcat "chromium:I *:E"`
{% endhint %}

The `android-release.sh` script has a shortcut that will build, install and start `adb logcat`:

```text
./android-release.sh run
```

You can now make purchase with on of your test accounts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
A test account can purchase an item in your product list only if the item is published.
{% endhint %}

### Purchase

Now that we have our purchase button, let's implement the `purchaseConsumable1` button.

```javascript
function purchaseConsumable1() {
    store.order('my_consumable1');
}
```

Can it be easier than that? Well, not so fast! The code as it is won't do much with this order request. To process the purchase we have to implement the various steps of the purchase flow.

I already introduced the purchase flow in the introduction, check the [Purchase process](../discover/about-the-plugin.md#purchase-process) section if you need a refresher. The official documentation provides more details. [â‡’ API Documentation](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/blob/master/doc/api.md#-purchasing) 

So the first thing that will happen is that the `canPurchase` state of the product will change to `false`. But remember, we added this in the previous step:

```javascript
store.when('my_consumable1 updated', refreshProductUI);
```

So we're covered. The UI will be refreshed when `canPurchase` changes.

When the user is done with the native interface \(enter his/her password and confirm\), you'll receive the `approved` event, let's handle it by adding the below to the `initStore()` function, before the call to `store.refresh()`.

```javascript
store.when('my_consumable1 approved', function(p) {
    p.verify();
});
```

```javascript
store.when('my_consumable1 verified', finishPurchase);
```

Then we will add the `finishPurchase` function at the end of our JavaScript file.

```javascript
function finishPurchase(p) {
    window.localStorage.goldCoins += 10;
    refreshGoldCoinsUI();
    p.finish();
}
```

This is a good enough implementation, but let's go one more step and setup a receipt validator.

For this tutorial, we will use Fovea's own service which is free while in development:

1. Head to [https://billing.fovea.cc/](https://billing.fovea.cc/) and create an Account.
2. Setup your project's package name and billing key, Save.
3. Go to the [Cordova Setup](https://billing-dashboard.fovea.cc/setup/cordova) page to copy the line `store.validator = "<something>"`.

Copy this line inside the `initStore()` function, anywhere before the initial `store.refresh()`. Also add the recommended `Content-Security-Policy` to your `index.html` as mentioned in the documentation.

Alright, we're done with coding! Let's try the whole thing now. We will repeat the steps from the [Testing](#testing) section above:

```text
./android-release.sh run
```

Here we go. Let's try to purchase from the app, make sure you are using one of the test account.
