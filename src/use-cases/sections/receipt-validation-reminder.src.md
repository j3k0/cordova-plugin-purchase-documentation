**Receipt Validation Reminder**

Remember, for subscriptions and non-consumables, relying solely on local device data is insecure and unreliable for managing entitlements.

**Always implement server-side receipt validation** using your own backend or a service like [Iaptic](https://www.iaptic.com/) to:
*   Confirm purchase legitimacy.
*   Get the authoritative subscription status and expiry date.
*   Prevent fraud.
*   Support cross-platform/device access.

Ensure `store.validator` is configured in your `initStore()` function.
