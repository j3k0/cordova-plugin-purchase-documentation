### 8. Prepare Test Accounts

To test your Google Play Billing implementation with actual in-app purchases, you must use a test account. By default, the only test account registered is the one that's associated with your developer account. You can register additional test accounts by using the Google Play Console.

1. Navigate to Settings > Account details.
2. In the License Testing section, add your tester's email addresses to Gmail accounts with testing access field.
3. Save your changes.
