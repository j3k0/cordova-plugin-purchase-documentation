## 5. Android Release APK

To generate a release build, I generally use the following script: [android-release.sh](https://gist.github.com/j3k0/28f60a7d5622508634d09f94c59d6dfc)

The script calls `cordova build android --release` with the correct command line arguments. It requires you have generated a `keystore` file for your application already.

If you haven't generated a keystore file for your application yet, you can use the following command line:

```text
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android-release.keystore -alias release \
-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

I'll ask you a few questions. The only tricky one is "Do you wan't to use the same password for the alias?", the answer is _yes_. Please note that the above command defines the keystore's `alias` as **release**, you can use any value, but just remember the value you chose.

Keep the `android-release.keystore` file in a safe place, backup it everywhere you can! Don't loose it, don't loose the password. You won't EVER be able to update your app on Google Play without it!

Then build.

```text
$ export KEYSTORE_ALIAS=release
$ export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=my_password
$ ./android-release.sh
```

Replace `$KEYSTORE_ALIAS` and `$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` with whatever match your those from your `keystore` file...

The output should end with a line like this:

```text
Build is ready:

<SOME_PATH>/android-release-20181015-1145.apk
```

There you go, this is your first release APK.
