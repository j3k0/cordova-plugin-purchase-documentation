## 5. Create In-App Products

If you followed the [Setup AppStore Application](3.-create-app-store-application.md) page, you should have everything setup. Head again to the App's In-App Purchases page: select your application, then _Features_, then _In-App Purchases_.

From there you can create your In-App Products. Select the appropriate type, fill in all required metadata and select _cleared for sale_.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if that sounds stupid, you need to fill-in ALL metadata in order to use the In-App Product in development, even the screenshot for reviewers. Make sure you have at least one localization in place too.
{% endhint %}

The process is well explained by Apple, so I'll not enter into more details.
